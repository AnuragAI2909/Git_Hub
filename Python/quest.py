# â€¢	Design a Python program as described below:
# o	a. Create a class called Palindrome.
# o	b. In your Palindrome class, create a method called reverse() which takes a string argument. Your method should return the reverse of the argument as a string.
# o	c. Create a second method in Palindrome called isPalindrome() which takes a string argument. This method should return True if the argument is a palindrome and False otherwise.
# o	d. Write some code to test your new Palindrome class and print out results of your testing to the user. Give some consideration to what sort of strings you might want to use for your testing.
